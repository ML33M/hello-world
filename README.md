# hello-world
Github told me so
Well I'm made in China and brewed in Melbourne Australia.
I was supposed to be in medcine then deviated a little to biomedical research
Now I'm a cancer researcher in Toronto Canada for my postdoc training. 
This postdoc project had really showed me I need to embrace coding, machine learning and unfortunately stats.
So here I am, causing trouble in the github.
